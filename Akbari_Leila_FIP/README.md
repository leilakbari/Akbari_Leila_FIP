# Project Name: FIP (Final Integrated Project)

# Project description:

First, I designed two website pages and two mobile pages with Adobe XD, and then I wrote their html and css codes based on the designs. The pages I designed are an online clothing store where you can buy women's clothing and accessories. Also, all the photos used on the pages (except for three photos) were taken by me.



The first, and perhaps most important, file is HTML which contains all contects (texts and images) of the web and mobile pages. So I started with HTML codes and added all the texts of the pages. HTML is enough to create a simple website, but the look of it wont be interesting! So I added color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS to my HTML files to make them visually dynamic.After the css was completed, the pages looked like the designs I had done in Adobe XD. 
I also created a new repository in GitHub (A site for developers to host and share their code or work on a project together.), and uploaded and edited the codes with the following steps:

* Git & Git workflow Steps
  * git clone
  * git add
  * git commit
  * git branch
  * git push
  * git pull
